# react-native-tableview

An initial attempt at bringing UITableView performance into React native. The current React native ListView implementation is good enough for most cases but has performance limitations. Attempting to use http://asyncdisplaykit.org/ to create a table view react native component. Help me!

Another example of performance issues: https://github.com/brentvatne/hard-react-native-problems/blob/master/1-swipable-nav-many-views.md
